A Back-end development project for **META** back-end developer course. It took approximetly 40 days for me to complete. I would recommend for those who wish to learn to try the course.

This is a web project for a fictonal restaurant called Little Lemon. For the final assesment of Django frame work, I have been task to complete a back-end for the Little Lemon.

I have learned creating models, views and url paths along with forms and model-forms. I have learned settings and how to disable debugger :\)

I have learned DTL and its implementation with html along with inheritence for extends and include!

MOST and MOST importantly Ä± learned how to create a VENV and how to connect MYSQL database with DJANGo frame work!

Feel free to try for yourself
